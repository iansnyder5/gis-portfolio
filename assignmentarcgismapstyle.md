## Source and Inspiration

I took a loose interpretation to what "inspires" me for this assignment (and for the stake of staying within copyright-free imagery). Using the prescribed "Adobe Color Trends" website, I found an image that contained two things that inspire me - architecture and nature - and combined them masterfully. The image, which I do not own, and can be found [here.](https://www.behance.net/gallery/90619697/House-in-Rio-de-Janeiro?tracking_source=curated_galleries_list)

For clarity, I've isolated the color palette that Adobe pulled from this image below:
